# Hibiki Privacy Policy
## Updated 30 July 2020

This Privacy Policy applies to personal information collected through jiktim's ("we", "us", or "our") "Hibiki" Discord application and website, "hibiki.app". If you have any questions, please contact jik@jikt.im or contact@hibiki.app.

Do note that this applies for the **official** instance of Hibiki (493904957523623936). Other instances may not respect this. 

## Information we collect

### hibiki.app
We collect information only when necessary for authentication. The information we collect does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or address).

We collect on hibiki.app:

- oAuth tokens: a read-only, encrypted & signed one-use token in order to verify the Discord account belongs to you. You can control the information we can get from the token, however, for proper authentication to work you must provide "user" and "guilds". This is stored in order to properly authenticate a user and is necessary for logging-in via Discord. If you do not wish to provide this, do not sign into the dashboard. Additionally, the token is invalidated upon logout (hibiki.app/logout/).

### Hibiki Application
We collect very little information, however, for some configurations and functionality to work, we need to collect the following:

- User & Server ID: a unique number for every Discord server ("guild") and user, this is stored in order to know which server should be modified and to verify if the user is authorized to modify the server. This is non-personal information and can be accessed by anyone. If you do not wish to provide this, do not use our bot (or any bot for that matter).

- Command Responses: some commands, such as the config or createCommand commands, ask for a resposne. We will store the msg.content data in order to send that response at a later time.

### Closure
We do not, and never will, sell or redistribute (your) user data. If you wish for us to remove all data, contact one of the developers or email us. Data may take up to 30 days to fully delete.
